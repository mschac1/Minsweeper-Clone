# Minsweeper-Clone
Project from 2003, uploaded to GIT
I wrote this project in 2003 just to see if I could do it. I adjusted it slightly today to account for the thicker window borders and then posted it. Not the best written code though
The exe file is the WindowsApplication1 in the bin/Debug directory
